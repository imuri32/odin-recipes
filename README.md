# odin-recipes

This project is about a webpage that includes links to some recipes.

Upon completing this project, I will have demonstrated my knowledge of:

-  Setting up an HTML boilerplate  

-  Using various HTML elements with their corresponding tags such as
 headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images.  
 
-  Setting up relative paths to access local files within the code.
